# default commands and ingoring text
by using the prefix ":" the bot will ignore you, to get the AI to run commands simply type some of the following text into a channel the bot is in.
1. : clear (clears the bot's current memeory)
2. : vc {optional: integer} (makes the bot join the VC you are currently in and plays a random sound that you can specify)
3. : leave (leaves the server the command was sent in)
